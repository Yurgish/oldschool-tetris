<p align="center">
  A retro-inspired Tetris clone built with Canvas, TypeScript, Three.js shaders, and Howler.js. The idea was born after seeing a frame from the Tetris movie 🎬 — I decided to code my own version with CRT-style visuals,   animations, scoring, and sound effects.

## 💡 Idea & Inspiration

The project started as a fun experiment:  

👉 I took a screenshot from the *Tetris* movie as inspiration and thought: *“Why not try building my own playable version?”*  

Here's that screenshot:

## ✨ Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Core
* **Canvas 2D API** – low-level rendering of tetrominoes and animations.  
* **TypeScript** – type-safe game logic and structure.
* **Three.js** + custom shaders – postprocessing layer for CRT/old TV look.
* **Howler.js** – lightweight audio library for playing game sound effects.  

### 🖥 Tooling
* **React + Vite** – mainly used for project bootstrapping.
